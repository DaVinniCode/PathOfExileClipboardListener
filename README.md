PathOfExileClipboardListener
============================

Written in Visual Studio 10 C#.Net targetting .NET 4.0 Framework.

Uses System.Data.SQLite ADO.NET library for SQLite (the 32-bit version for VS10).

============================
Known Issues:

- some items incorrectly report that not all affixes were parsed when they were.  This is due to implicit mods and will be looked at next (should now be fixed);
- If an item has an affix that gives two bonuses AND it has one of those bonuses on its own on another affix then the parser fails to work this out properly.  I am going to add some code to guess the values and indicate this in the UI as this is the best that can be done in these cases (should now be fixed - but needs a lot of testing);
- Characters and Leagues aren't complete;
- Flasks, Quivers and Unqiues aren't parsed;
- IIR doesn't work properly because it can be a prefix AND a suffix :(
