- Handle mods when they are implict better, remove them from the list of mods if they match on ModId and Value, be careful there might be a double +Accuracy on a weapon for example, with one mod being a prefix and the other implict;

- When there are mods left unassigned put in some hardcoded fixes for hybrid affixes to try and guess the values;

- Make caching work better, probably with a LINQ search in the Lists?
